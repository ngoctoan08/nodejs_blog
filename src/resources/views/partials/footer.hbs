Your API should return a consistent data format. Typical formats for a REST API are
XML and JSON. We’ll be using JSON for our API because it’s the natural fit for the
MEAN stack, and it’s more compact than XML, so it can help speed up the response
times of an API.
Our API will return one of three things for each request:
■ A JSON object containing data answering the request query
■ A JSON object containing error data
■ A null response
During this chapter we’ll discuss how to do all of these things as we build the Loc8r
API. As well as responding with data, any REST API should return the correct HTTP status code.
